### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data and provide meaningful insights to stakeholders, such as:

•	The spread of the virus over time.

• Demographics affected by COVID-19.

• Key trends in recovery and death rates.

• Global comparison of affected regions.

The project is divided into the following key steps:

1. Requirement Gathering
2. Stakeholder Identification
3. Data Modeling
4. Data Cleaning and Processing
5. Data Visualization
6. Insights Generation

### Data Sources
The dataset used for this project is sourced from various publicly available COVID-19 data repositories:

Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dataset: This dataset includes global cases, recoveries, and death counts.
World Health Organization (WHO): Reports used for validating the data and providing context.
Additional Data Sources: Supplementary demographic data used to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on various age groups and regions.
Steps Involved
1. Requirement Gathering
Understand the objectives and metrics that stakeholders want to track. Key focus areas include cases by region, recovery trends, and fatality rates.

2. Stakeholder Identification
Identify the key stakeholders who will use the report and adjust the analysis to meet their needs (e.g., health officials, policymakers, data scientists).

3. Data Modeling
Create the data model using COVID-19 data and supplemental sources. The data model includes tables representing confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and related demographic data.

4. Data Cleaning and Processing
Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset.
Use data normalization and aggregation to prepare for visualization.
Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) were used to clean and transform the data.
5. Data Visualization
Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create visual representations of the data.
Line graphs, bar charts, and heatmaps are used to represent trends in COVID-19 cases over time.
Visualizations help identify patterns and anomalies in the data.
6. Insights Generation

### Analyze the data to uncover:

Regions with the highest impact of COVID-19.
Time series trends of active cases, recoveries, and deaths.
Insights into age and gender demographics most affected by the pandemic.
Data Visualizations
Screenshots and plots generated from the analysis can be found in the plots/ directory. These include:

Global Spread Over Time: Line graphs showing the cumulative number of cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
Regional Analysis: Bar charts comparing the impact of COVID-19 across different countries.
Demographic Analysis: Heatmaps displaying the spread of COVID-19 across different age groups.

### Conclusion and Insights
Key findings from the analysis include:

The peak periods of COVID-19 cases across different regions.
Correlation between healthcare infrastructure and recovery rates.
The effect of government policies on reducing the spread of the virus.
